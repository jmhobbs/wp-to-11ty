# wp-to-11ty

`wp-to-11ty` is a tool that will take a WordPress XML Export and (attempt to) convert it into a new [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site.

This is an early tool, written for my use case, and will possibly (probably) not work perfectly for your use case, but that's ok!

I'd love to make it better, and make it more flexible, but I only have the one blog to export and test it with, so please [file an issue](https://github.com/jmhobbs/wp-to-11ty/issues/new) if something doesn't work for you.

There's a little bit more details on the overall process available [on my blog](https://velvetcache.org/2023/04/05/moving-from-wordpress-to-11ty/)
